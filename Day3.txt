Assignment 2::Difference between var, let and const 
  
var: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is         defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
         var is “function scoped”.

let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let”  is limited to the “block” defined by curly              braces i.e. {} .
      “let” is “block scoped”.

const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block . However if a                  variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
           “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. 
           “const” is “block scoped”.


Assignment 3::Data types in JavaScript

1)Number
   Ex:
   n = 123;
   n = 12.345;
   The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
   There are many operations for numbers, 
       e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
Right now BigInt is supported in Firefox/Chrome/Edge, but not in Safari/IE.

2)String
   Ex:
   str = "Double quotes";
   str2 = 'Single quotes';
   str3 = `Backticks`;
   A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.
   In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes:
         Double quotes: "Hello".
         Single quotes: 'Hello'.
         Backticks: `Hello`.

3)Boolean
   The boolean type has only two values: true and false.
   This type is commonly used to store yes/no values:
           true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.
   Ex:
     a = true; // yes
     b = false; // no
